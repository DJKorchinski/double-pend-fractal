# Newton-Fractal-Vis
A hand hewn Javascript+Canvas implementation of the double pendulum fractal.

Check out the [simulation](https://djkorchinski.github.io/double-pend-fractal/)!

This was inspired by this [article][https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~vmarconi/fiscomp/Double.pdf] by Jeremy S. Heyl, who is coincidentally a professor at the University of British Columbia, where I completed by PhD.
